    <p>On <span class="style3">Sunday 3rd May, 2015 we are celebrating our 33rd Fun Run</span> with our usual events plus many  special celebratory activities. The events are the 10 Mile Fun Run, 6 Mile Fun  Run and 6 Mile Fun Walk. They start and finish at Young Epilepsy (formerly NCYPE), in St Piers Lane,  Lingfield, RH7 6PW. The races start from 12 noon to 12.20, but do come  along earlier and enjoy the Family Fun day, which starts at 10am  and continues through the afternoon. </p>
    <p><br />
      The courses take you through the villages  of Dormansland and Lingfield, mainly on  road/pavements and hard paths across fields. Families and youngsters are  welcomed in the 6 mile events (actually about 6.4 miles!)  The 10 mile event (actually about 10.4 miles!) is restricted to  adults, 18 and over. Fancy Dress runners, walkers and spectators are welcome,  and prizes will be awarded for these before the races.&nbsp; As much of the course is along roads we do  ask all entrants to take special care, keeping to the pavements wherever  possible, following the Highway Code and instructions of police and race marshals.  Youngsters should be accompanied by a responsible adult.</p>
